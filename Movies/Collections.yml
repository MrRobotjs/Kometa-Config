    summary:

      I use Editions to show where I got the film from, for example, if I got a film from a Blu-ray source then it'll show Blu-ray and the same goes if I got the film from Netflix and any other streaming service. The list below goes more into depth of what each Edition means.

      B͟l͟u͟-r͟a͟y͟ R͟e͟m͟u͟x͟: Ripped from a Blu-ray source, for the highest quality possible. Typically these will include extra's.
      B͟l͟u͟-r͟a͟y͟ */I͟M͟A͟X͟/H͟D͟R͟/R͟e͟m͟a͟s͟t͟e͟r͟e͟d͟: Ripped and re-encoded from a Blu-ray source, for the highest quality possible. Typically these will include extra's.
      B͟l͟u͟-r͟a͟y͟ R͟E͟G͟I͟O͟N͟: This plays a huge role for those of you who enjoy Anime. Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, Redline and Akira are a few examples that have (arguably to Japan) superior film overseas than in the states. example: Blu-ray Italian
      ##t͟h͟ A͟n͟n͟i͟v͟e͟r͟s͟a͟r͟y͟, C͟o͟l͟l͟e͟c͟t͟o͟r͟'s͟: Self Explanatory. These are equivalent to Blu-ray, didn't include Blu-ray to keep the edition name short.
      4͟K R͟e͟m͟a͟s͟t͟e͟r͟: 4K Blu-ray films remastered but re-released in 1080p (reason why it's not in the 4K/HDR library). Typically these are far superior than the original 1080p release which could have been years back.
      ##m͟m͟ (m͟i͟l͟l͟i͟m͟e͟t͟e͟r): Straight film like the old days. May or may not be color graded and high chance of grime and scratches. Best used with projectors.
      N͟e͟t͟f͟l͟i͟x͟/H͟B͟O͟ M͟a͟x͟/D͟i͟s͟n͟e͟y͟+ (s͟t͟r͟e͟a͟m͟i͟n͟g͟ p͟l͟a͟t͟f͟o͟r͟m͟ n͟a͟m͟e): Direct download from a streaming service without re-encoding. Typically these are the best downloads from streaming services.
      W͟e͟b͟/W͟E͟B͟-D͟L͟/W͟E͟B͟R͟i͟p͟: Direct download from a streaming service but the streaming service is unknown. Typically these are the best downloads from streaming services.
      S͟p͟a͟n͟i͟s͟h͟: Usually duplicates of existing films in the library but in Spanish. Why a duplicate? I rather have a superior film in terms of visual and audio in English since it's in my primary language but I do try to have Spanish films for family/friends. May include English but not always.
